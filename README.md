SimpleToolsForU - ChiperLock 
## SimpleToolsForU
A project established by my friend Sagi Bar Yosef. We divided the work between us and this application was built and designed by me
## Main Idea
The application will read and save databases, which store passwords for websites, applications, etc. The application will encrypt them before saving and before opening it will decrypt, each time it is opened it also replaces the encryption key.
## Keybinds:
* Ctrl + Shift + S: Save Database as
* Ctrl + S: Save Database
* Ctrl + O: Open Database
* Ctrl + D: Clone Group/Entry
* Ctrl + E: Edit Group/Entry
* Ctrl + Shift + E: Edit Database
* Delete: Delete Group/Entry
* Ctrl + Shift + Z: Undo to original Save
## Notice
* Theres no settings option
* When error occours there will be no message to informs the user
## Modules:
* Electron JS
* Node-RSA
